# LaunchAJar

### Hi!
Welcome! If you're wondering, LaunchAJar is the name of my easy-to-use editable app to launch a jarfile.

### That seems cool. So how do I download this?
Just go to the project page at https://github.com/ili-codes/applescript-utils/tree/launch-a-jar and click on Download ZIP.

### Bye!!
