# AppleScript Utils, aka Do It!

### Hi!
Welcome to this page! If you're wondering, Do It! is the name of my collection of cool utilities for Mac. Written in AppleScript, these cool apps help you do things that might be annoying to do otherwise, like launching jarfiles, or turning off stuff, changing settings and resolutions, and going in Terminal to type in a bunch of code.

### That seems cool. So how do I download this?
Just go to the project page at http://github.com/ili-codes/applescript-utils/ and click on which app you'd like to download. Source code is the .scpt and apps are in .zip. Click "View Raw" and it will download.

### Bye!!
